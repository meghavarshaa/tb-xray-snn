# TB Chest X-ray Spiking Neural Network Classifier

This project uses Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) to classify chest X-ray images as 'Normal' or 'Tuberculosis', inspired by brain-like computation.

## Steps implemented so far
- Data preprocessing (resize, normalization, train/test split)
- Image to spike train encoding
- Initial SNN architecture and training scripts (using BindsNET)

## What remains
- Training and testing on full data (requires powerful hardware/cloud)
- Detailed evaluation and visualization

## Note
Due to large size, `.npy` spike train arrays and raw data are NOT pushed to GitHub.
